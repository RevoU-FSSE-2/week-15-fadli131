### Getting Started

## RESTful Principles

The Financial Tracking API adheres to the principles of RESTful design to ensure a standardized and user-friendly experience:

1. **Resources**: The API treats financial entities such as transactions and accounts as resources, each accessible through a unique endpoint.

2. **HTTP Methods**: HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE are employed to interact with these resources.

3. **Representation**: Data is exchanged in JSON format, allowing for structured and easy-to-parse information.
